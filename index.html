    <div class="content">
        <p>Empathy and sympathy wax and wane when years are counted in millions and thousands. The cusp of a new world order or the first to fall from the heavens, Rhean Eyadu slowly learns how to survive as she's left adrift and alone across the endless sea and atop the highest mountains.</p>
        <p>Rhean's modern companions, Dorus Chatahyuk, Othil Utenyest, and Kronates Skia, join her for the journey. More a band of temporarily aligned incentives than true allies, each plays their part as long as they receive something in return.</p>
        <p>What awaits in prayer and song is nothing less than salvation. Rhean slowly learns the full price of waging a war to end all wars while wielding her sword, Nox Aeterna.</p>
        <p>And in the end, the questions of good and evil mean nothing to the time she spends with fallen comrades.</p>
